# 🚀 High-Frequency Trading Strategies - INTER IIT 13.0 Silver Medal Project
This repository contains the HFT strategies that helped us secure the Silver Medal at INTER IIT Tech Meet 13.0, outperforming top-tier competitors — including AIR-1 Mridul Agarwal.

We tackled the complex challenge of building profit-maximizing alpha signals and optimal execution strategies using a blend of event-based modeling and statistical machine learning.


## 🧠 Core Strategies
### 1. predator.py
Implements a high-performance market-making bot with aggressive quote placement logic.Uses inventory-based signal adaptation and real-time position monitoring.

### 2. btc_final_hawkes.py & eth_final_hawkes.py
These scripts use Hawkes process-based modeling for BTC and ETH markets respectively.Learn self-exciting event sequences to forecast short-term price jumps.

### 🏆 Why This Matters
We crafted this system under tight constraints and real-time simulation environments.
Leveraged alpha signal stacking, feature engineering, and market microstructure intuition.
